### New set of 1-Day OC images for the Gulf of Mexico
This is a test. Currently, files are created by @dotis via gpt mosaic on manglillo in NetCDF-CF format.  
We have found issues getting these files into ERDDAP.  
We may need to output from gpt in an alternative .nc format to get into ERDDAP.  
However, NetCDF-CF should work per ERDDAP documentation.
